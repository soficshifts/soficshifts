Hello GitHub world and welcome to my GitHub.

I've been coding since I was a wee lad; starting on the Commodore Vic 20, and making a career out of it.  While I live to code, I no longer code to live.  I'll code on my time with my interests and no management interferance.

Here you'll find some hobby code of my interests, which you are welcome to use or use for inspiration for your own projects.

Just starting, but more repositories will come.
